Step 1: Data Modelling
Created a notebook to inspect the frist 5 rows of the six supplied CSV files.
Used QuickDBD to create an easy to follow structure when making tables, connecting which columns shared the same names.

Step 2: Data Engineering
Exported QuickDBD file into PgAdmin.
Reworked code to input Primary Keys and Foreign Keys and make sure that tables ran correctly in the right order according to required Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.
Ran code for each individual table and imported each CSV file into designated table, comparing to CSV files on the CSV preview notebook to ensure data and tables were correct.

Step 3: Data Analysis
Created a queries.sql file to run analysis for each required query.
Completed code for each question, ran each block individually and downloaded file to allow for ease of reading and reviewing data analysis.

Committed and pushed all changes to github for submission.
